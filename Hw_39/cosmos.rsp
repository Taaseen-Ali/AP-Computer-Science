Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

-the size of human knowledge in comparison to what we dont know must be miniscule. Although this fact seems obvious, its easy to forget since we always emphasize how "far we've come" in comparison to ancient civilizations.The show does
a good job at emphasizing this point.

-wait doesnt Tyson's son go to stuy?

-The earths address seems like something not too useful. I think it would be like giving my home address to a native tribesperson in the amazon. Even though the address points to a specific place, getting there or knowing how to get
there isn't too feasible

-the scientific method seems to be the human method. I think most people think in the steps of the scientific method naturally which is why scientific discoveries occured far before such a method was made explicit. The scientific
method I feel, is simply a standardization of this natural human thinking in order to keep scientific  discoveries consistent in terems of quality.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

-its amazing to think that only in a couple thousand years humans have created all the species of dogs that we see today. We played a role in evolution.

-the fact that we could accomplish this over such a short period of time is amazing. I can only imagine what is possible over millions of years.

-the evolution of the eye and its presentation in the documentary was very interesting.

-I wonder what new changes the eye will undergo in the next million years.

-Tyson has a nice moustache.

-OOH WATER BEARS ARE SO COOL. THEYRE LIKE TINY MANATEES.
